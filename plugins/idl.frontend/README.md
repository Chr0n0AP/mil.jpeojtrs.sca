# Plugin idl.frontend

Contains Java bindings for the FRONTEND IDL.

## Notes on versioning

In the REDHAWK Core Framework, the version of the FRONTEND interfaces is different from the version of REDHAWK:

| REDHAWK | FRONTEND |
| ------- | -------- |
| 1.8.0   | 2.0.0    |
| 2.0.0   | 2.3.0    |

However, in the IDE we use the REDHAWK version even when describing the FRONTEND interfaces (as seen in this bundle).
